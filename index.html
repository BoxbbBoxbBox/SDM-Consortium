    <h1>Missouri Supported Decision-Making Consortium</h1>
        <p>The Missouri Supported Decision-Making Consortium is a group of people in Missouri who work to advance Supported Decision-Making.</p>
    <h2>What is Supported Decision-Making?</h2>
        <p><strong>Supported Decision-Making</strong>, sometimes called <strong>SDM</strong>, is a way to make decisions with help from other people. You are using Supported Decision-Making whenever you ask someone for help making or communicating decisions. In Missouri, Supported Decision-Making is a legally recognized alternative to guardianship.</p>
    <h2>What are the principles behind Supported Decision-Making?</h2>
        <p class="principles">The Consortium agrees on the following principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Inclusive</strong>: All people should have the chance to be full and equal members of their community. This is true no matter their age or ability.</li>
            <li><strong>Individualized</strong>: SDM should be flexible and made to meet individual needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Person-Centered</strong>: SDM should be driven by the person who wants supports. That person should choose their own supporters and types of support.</li>
            <li><strong>Advice Only</strong>: SDM helps a person make a choice - it does not replace their choice. Support is advice, and a person can take it or leave it.</li>
        </ul>
